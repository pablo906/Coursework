        Malcom Reynolds is a veteran and a hero of the great Unification War.  Mal saw first hand the horrors of war and the abuses of the Alliance.  A fiercely independent man, he decided to escape civilized society and make his way among the stars with a small group of loyal rag tag outcasts looking to both escape their pasts and build a new future and family on their own terms.
