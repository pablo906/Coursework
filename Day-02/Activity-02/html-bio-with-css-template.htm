        Malcom Reynolds is a veteran and a hero of the great Unification War.  Mal saw first hand the horrors of war and the abuses of the Alliance.  
          A fiercely independent man, he decided to escape civilized society and make his way among the stars with a small group of loyal rag tag outcasts looking to both escape their pasts and build a new future and family on their own terms.
          Now humanity has pushed among the stars, creating large swathes of "frontier" with the borders resembling a sci-fi version of the great American Western Expansion, without the genocide, maybe....

        Firefly is through and through a Joss Whedon show.  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/Firefly">Character study, rich backstory, conflict, what it means to be human, and a haunted past are all hallmarks </a>of a Joss Whedon show and they're richly developed over a brief period in Serenity.
          After the phenomenon that was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> fans were excited to see another Joss Whedon show picked up by Fox.
          After just 1 short season Fox cancelled the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWestern">Space Western</a> and led to a new phenomenon in Television that has since been dubbed <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect">"The Firefly Effect"</a>.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Firefly was significantly harmed by Fox leadership from the onset.  A disjointed marketing and promo campaign that tried to depict the show as a genre-bending comedy disappointed people who tuned in because of the promos and alienated sci-fi fans who were looking for more traditional science fiction, what the show actually was.
          Fox not only marketed the show wrong and created bad ads and trailers, they aired the show completely out of order, leaving viewers confused and without context from the first episode.  
          This negatively impacted the Nielsen ratings significantly, leading to an abysmal 4.5 million views on average.  For reference HBO's Game of Thrones started at 2.5 million views average for the first season.
          The DVD was released shortly after cancellation and had the episodes in the proper order.  
          The DVD sales were a wild success and the show became something of a pop culture<a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/statistics-show-firefly-is-the-most-beloved-short-lived-1787317090"> phenomenon.</a>
